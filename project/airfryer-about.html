            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                The airfryer, first intoduced by Dutch engineer Fred Van Der Weij in 2010, was created to combat it unhealthy counterpart of frying food in oil.
                Philips Electronics realzing it's potential collaborated with Fred Van Der Weij and got the patent rights to the innovative creation.
                The airfryer became a massive hit with the increase in the awareness of healthy food choices. It's ability to turn frozen food into 
                a crispy meal was an added bonus. The technology however has been in use since the forties. Conventional ovens employ the same technology 
                and airfryers are essentaily compact versions of them. The first to be commercially released was The Maxson Whirlwind oven in 1945 and the
                oven has been improved throught the years. Interestingly some types of convention ovens are used to sterilize medical equipment.
